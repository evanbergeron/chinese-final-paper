abstract="Shanghai is the largest commercial and industrial city of China, but air quality issues have hindered its development in becoming a ``global city.'' This study used monitoring data on SO2, NO                  x                , acid rain pH, dustfall, and total suspended particles (TSP) from the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center to evaluate and analyze the air quality in urban, suburban, and rural areas during the period 1983--2005. The results showed that the spatial pattern of air parameters was determined by the level of urbanization; thus, the higher the level of urbanization, the worse the air quality. On the whole, the atmospheric environment of the three spatial regions improved gradually because of economical growth and environmental protection since the 1990s. For the entire region of Shanghai, the relationship between the integrated air quality index and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) due to decreasing air quality in suburban and rural areas this century. Thus, environmental controls should be increased in Shanghai, especially in developing suburban and rural areas during rapid urbanization.",

title="The urban heat island and its impact on heat waves and human health in Shanghai",

abstract="With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975--2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998--2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.",

title="Variations in New York city's urban heat island strength over time and space",

abstract="We analyse historical (1900 -- present) and recent (year 2002) data on New York city's urban heat island (UHI) effect, to characterize changes over time and spatially within the city. The historical annual data show that UHI intensification is responsible for ∼1/3 of the total warming the city has experienced since 1900. The intensification correlates with a significant drop in windspeed over the century, likely due to an increase in the urban boundary layer as Manhattan's extensive skyline development unfolded. For the current-day, using 2002 data, we calculate the hourly and seasonal strength of the city's UHI for five different case study areas, including sites in Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. We find substantial intra-city variation (∼2{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C) in the strength of the hourly UHI, with some locations showing daytime cool islands -- i.e., temperatures lower than the average of the distant non-urban stations, while others, at the same time, show daytime heat islands. The variations are not easily explained in terms of land surface characteristics such as building stock, population, vegetation fraction or radiometric surface temperatures from remote sensing. Although it has been suggested that stations within urban parks will underestimate UHI, the Central Park station does not show a significant underestimate, except marginally during summer nights. The intra-city heat island variations in the residential areas broadly correlate with summertime electricity demand and sensitivity to temperature increases. This relationship will have practical value for energy demand management policy, as it will help prioritize areas for UHI mitigation.",

abstract ={Using multiple data sources, we establish that China's income inequality since 2005 has reached very high levels, with the Gini coefficient in the range of 0.53–0.55. Analyzing comparable survey data collected in 2010 in China and the United States, we examine social determinants that help explain China’s high income inequality. Our results indicate that a substantial part of China’s high income inequality is due to regional disparities and the rural-urban gap. The contributions of these two structural forces are particularly strong in China, but they play a negligible role in generating the overall income inequality in the United States, where individual-level and family-level income determinants, such as family structure and race/ethnicity, play a much larger role.},
