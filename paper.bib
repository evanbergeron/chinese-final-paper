abstract="Shanghai is the largest commercial and industrial city of China, but air quality issues have hindered its development in becoming a ``global city.'' This study used monitoring data on SO2, NO                  x                , acid rain pH, dustfall, and total suspended particles (TSP) from the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center to evaluate and analyze the air quality in urban, suburban, and rural areas during the period 1983--2005. The results showed that the spatial pattern of air parameters was determined by the level of urbanization; thus, the higher the level of urbanization, the worse the air quality. On the whole, the atmospheric environment of the three spatial regions improved gradually because of economical growth and environmental protection since the 1990s. For the entire region of Shanghai, the relationship between the integrated air quality index and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) due to decreasing air quality in suburban and rural areas this century. Thus, environmental controls should be increased in Shanghai, especially in developing suburban and rural areas during rapid urbanization.",

title="Temporal and spatial characteristics of the urban heat island during rapid urbanization in Shanghai, China",

abstract="Based on meteorological data from 1978 to 2007, we investigated the annual, seasonal, and fixed hourly variations of Shanghai urban heat island (UHI) in urban and suburban areas and spatial distribution of UHI. The results demonstrated a remarkable interannual increase of UHI intensity in Shanghai. The UHI was the strongest in autumn and the weakest in summer, as a consequence of the prevailing weather conditions. Similar to previous studies of other cities, the UHI in Shanghai was stronger in the nighttime than in the daytime. The SW--NE cross section followed the general cross section of the typical UHI described by Oke (1987) who defines its characteristic parts as ``cliff'', ``plateau'', and ``peak''. Analysis of the association of UHI and urbanization indicated that the UHI increased with the expansion of population and rapid increase of gross domestic product. The continuous increase of power consumption and area of paved road and decrease of area of cropland caused the growth of UHI intensity. Green land had a positive effect on mitigation of heat island based on an inversed U-shaped curve with UHI intensity.",

abstract="With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30Â years of meteorological records (1975--2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998--2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.",
